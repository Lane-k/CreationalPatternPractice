# CreationalPatternPractice
This repo is similar to my behavioral patterns, wherein I will attempt to showcase some knowledge about the use and creation of OOP creational patterns. They may not be 100% accurate or the most detailed, but they should server to solidify some key concepts in my own head and serve as reference moving forward in my career and studies.

# Note for Compilation
as before, I will use a 3 folder approach with an include for header files, an src for my .cpp implementations and a mains for my .cpp main files for each showcase. 
To compile everything use:
g++ -I./include src/Demo.cpp main/DemoMain.cpp -o DemoExeName
